At the beginning of each game, the computer randomly chooses one of several opponents.
Some opponent may be encountered more often; they have different probabilities of appearing.
Every opponent has his own list of preferences, strategies.

- 'Norman Reedus' – tends toward a balanced approach.
- 'Chris Rock' – prefers stone, but respects paper as well.
- 'Leonard Nimoy' – strategist, Stoic.
- 'Loki Odinson' – you don't expect to play fair when you sit down at the same table with Loki, do you?
